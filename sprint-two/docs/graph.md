**Edge Cases**:

## addNode
value that is already present in the graph. ex: "apple" is in the graph and we try to add "apple" again. Or two people with the same name.

# Justification
<!-- ## Purpose of Calling this Function -->
## addNode
to add a new node to the graph

# Explanation
<!-- ## Clearly state relationship between Inputs and Outputs in Plain English -->
## addNode
We will take in a value and create a node with that value in the graph. It is not connected to anything at this point. Must use .addEdge to connect it.
